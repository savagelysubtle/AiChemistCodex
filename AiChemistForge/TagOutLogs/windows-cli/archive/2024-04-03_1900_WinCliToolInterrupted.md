**Date Reported:** 2024-04-03 19:00
**Tool:** windows-cli (mcp_Server_Win_Cli_Global_execute_command)
**Workspace/Project:** D:\Coding\TheToolShed\Brain\cursor-db-mcp

---

## 1. Actions Before Event

*   Attempting to verify the structure of the `.venv\Scripts` directory for the `cursor-db-mcp` project.
*   Wanted to check if the virtual environment was correctly set up and what scripts were available.
*   Executed the `mcp_Server_Win_Cli_Global_execute_command` tool to run a PowerShell command.

## 2. Input Provided (If Applicable)

```json
{
  "shell": "powershell",
  "command": "Get-ChildItem -Path \"D:\\Coding\\TheToolShed\\Brain\\cursor-db-mcp\\.venv\\Scripts\" -Force",
  "workingDir": "D:\\Coding\\TheToolShed\\Brain\\cursor-db-mcp"
}
```

## 3. Expected Outcome

*   Expected the tool to return a listing of files and directories within `D:\Coding\TheToolShed\Brain\cursor-db-mcp\.venv\Scripts`.
*   Should have shown Python, pip, and any other executables in the virtual environment.

## 4. Actual Outcome (Error Details)

*   **Summary:** The tool call did not complete successfully and returned an error indicating it was likely interrupted.
*   **Error Code/Message:**
    ```
    Error: no result from tool. The user likely interrupted the tool call to send you a message.
    ```

## 5. Initial Diagnosis / Possible Fixes

*   The error message suggests the tool call was interrupted by a new message being sent before completion.
*   **Fixes:**
    * Wait longer after initiating a tool call before sending new messages.
    * Could also verify if the path `D:\Coding\TheToolShed\Brain\cursor-db-mcp\.venv\Scripts` actually exists. -- IS VERIFIED DIR exists at expected location.
    * Try using standard terminal tools instead of an MCP tool for this operation.
