# Plan: Core Documentation Review & Enhancement

**Objective**: Ensure the foundational documentation for AiChemist Codex (`SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION_HUB.md`) is accurate, comprehensive, and aligned with the project's standards as outlined in [`002-catalyst-documentation-standard.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/002-catalyst-documentation-standard.mdc).

**Status**: Initial Draft

## Known Issues & Blockers

*   **MCP Tool Connectivity**: Persistent failure in accessing `mcp_Rust_*` tools (e.g., `read_file`, `create_directory`). Error message: "No server found with tool: [tool_name]". This prevents programmatic access to files and directories needed for automated review and updates. Manual provision of file content may be required.

## 1. Review Existing Core Documentation

*   **Action**: Read and analyze `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    *   **Check**: Does the file exist?
    *   **Assess**:
        *   Accuracy against the current state of `AiChemistCodex`.
        *   Completeness in describing the high-level architecture.
        *   Clarity and adherence to documentation standards.
        *   Consistency with project READMEs and `.cursor/AiChemistCodex.md`.
*   **Action**: Read and analyze `docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION_HUB.md`.
    *   **Check**: Does the file exist?
    *   **Assess**:
        *   Accuracy of links to individual project documentation.
        *   Completeness in providing access to all relevant project-specific resources (READMEs, architecture docs, roadmaps, feature guides).
        *   Clarity and ease of navigation.

## 2. Identify Gaps and Required Updates

*   **Action**: Based on the review, list all identified discrepancies, missing information, or areas needing improvement for both documents.
*   **Consider**:
    *   Are there any new projects or major architectural changes not yet reflected?
    *   Do the documents effectively guide both new and existing contributors?

## 3. Plan and Prioritize Enhancements

*   **Action**: For each identified issue, outline the specific changes or additions needed.
*   **Action**: Prioritize the updates based on impact and effort.

## 4. Implement Documentation Changes

*   **Action**: Update `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` according to the plan.
*   **Action**: Update `docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION_HUB.md` according to the plan.
*   **Ensure**: All changes adhere to [`002-catalyst-documentation-standard.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/002-catalyst-documentation-standard.mdc).

## 5. Review and Finalize

*   **Action**: Conduct a final review of the updated documents.
*   **Action**: Ensure the workspace context file (`.cursor/AiChemistCodex.md`) and the main `README.md` reflect any significant changes made to these core documents.

## Next Steps:

*   Proceed with Step 1: Review `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
