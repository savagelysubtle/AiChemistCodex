# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è AiChemist Codex üß™

Welcome to the AiChemist Codex! This is the central hub for a suite of AI-powered tools designed for developers and researchers.

This repository acts as a parent container for several independent projects, each residing in its own Git repository within their respective subdirectories.

## Projects

The Codex currently comprises the following projects:

1.  **[üß™ AiChemist Archivum](./AiChemistArchivum/README.md)**
    *   An AI-driven file-management platform.
    *   Manages and queries content via embeddings, regex, or semantic search.
    *   Exposes workflows through CLI, gRPC/JSON API, and a desktop GUI.
    *   *Independent Git Repository located in: `./AiChemistArchivum/`*
    *   See its [README](./AiChemistArchivum/README.md) for more details.

2.  **[üìö AiChemist Compendium](./AiChemistCompendium/README.md)**
    *   An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.
    *   Enables AI assistants to interact with Obsidian vaults.
    *   Provides tools for reading, creating, editing, and managing notes and tags.
    *   *Independent Git Repository located in: `./AiChemistCompendium/`*
    *   See its [README](./AiChemistCompendium/README.md) for more details.

3.  **[üîÑ AiChemist Transmutations](./AiChemistTransmutations/README.md)**
    *   A Python library for converting between different document formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML).
    *   Features OCR support for scanned documents.
    *   Offers CLI, GUI, and Electron bridge interfaces.
    *   *Independent Git Repository located in: `./AiChemistTransmutations/`*
    *   See its [README](./AiChemistTransmutations/README.md) for more details.

## Structure & Philosophy

Each project within the Codex (`Archivum`, `Compendium`, `Transmutations`) is maintained in its own Git repository. This parent `AiChemistCodex` repository is intended to:
-   Provide an overarching structure and entry point to the suite.
-   Hold documentation and resources relevant to the entire AiChemist ecosystem.
-   Facilitate coordination if needed, without entangling the individual project histories.

To work with an individual project, navigate to its subdirectory (e.g., `cd AiChemistArchivum`) and use Git commands as you normally would for any standalone repository.

This setup allows for both separation of concerns and co-location, ensuring that each project can evolve independently while being part of a larger, cohesive suite.

## Next Steps for Documentation ("Sick Ass Docs")

This README provides the initial overview. To build out "sick ass docs," we can consider:
-   **Overall Architecture Diagram**: A visual representation of how the AiChemist components (could) interact.
-   **Core Concepts**: Explaining key philosophies or technologies shared across the projects.
-   **Inter-Project Communication**: If applicable, how the projects might communicate or share data.
-   **Contribution Guidelines**: How to contribute to the Codex or individual projects.
-   **Development Environment Setup**: For the entire Codex, if there are shared tools or practices.
-   **Roadmap for the Codex**: High-level goals for the suite.
-   **Showcase/Demo**: Instructions or links to demos showcasing the combined power of the tools.
